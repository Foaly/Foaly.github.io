Hello the Internet!
===================

This is my first Blog post.
I've been playing around with the idea to set up a place where I can dump ideas and share projects I am working on.
After the 33c3 the time had finally come.
So here we are.

My main interests are in programming, especially C++, DSP, music synthesis and real time graphics.
But I have a broader interest in robots, hardware, software, food...
So basically technology and hacking in general.

I am still fighting a bit with github pages and Jekyll, so things might change around a bit.

Anyway I hope you I enjoy my posts and maybe learn something.

__Hack all the things!__
